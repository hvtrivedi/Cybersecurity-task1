Cyber Security Internship â€“ Task 1

Task: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

Objective:
To perform basic network reconnaissance using Nmap, identify open ports and services on the local network, and understand potential security risks.

Steps Performed:
1. Installed Nmap from the official site.
2. Found my local IP range using ipconfig/ifconfig (example: 192.168.1.0/24).
3. Ran TCP SYN scan using:
   nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
4. Observed results and noted devices with open ports.
5. Analyzed services running on common ports (22, 80, 443, 3389).
6. Used Wireshark optionally to capture packets.

Sample Nmap Results:
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.5
Host is up (0.0021s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server

Analysis of Security Risks:
- Port 22 (SSH): Brute force attacks possible if weak authentication used.
- Port 80 (HTTP): Unencrypted communication vulnerable to sniffing.
- Port 443 (HTTPS): More secure but depends on TLS configuration.
- Port 3389 (RDP): Often targeted by attackers for remote access.

Recommendations:
- Close unused ports.
- Use strong passwords or key-based authentication.
- Restrict RDP access with VPN/firewall rules.
- Keep systems updated and patched.

Key Concepts:
Port scanning, TCP SYN scan, IP ranges, reconnaissance, open ports, security risks.
